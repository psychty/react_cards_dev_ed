# React, according to Edwin

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGcsHMXbSOA&t=142s&ab_channel=DevEd][dev eds explanation of react components]

\*\* Things that React enables

- Modularising components
- Render html from a single js file rather than needing to reference an object in the html that is later picked up and has something done to it from the js file (e.g. getelementid)

Create a new js file in the src folder for each component

Edit the css for components and the overall html file.
Invoke classes on divs using the className function in react rather than simply saying class =

\*\* Remove the boilerplat app css (for the spinning react logo

You can repeat components to render them in several places and customise each iteration using props values
Use props to draw data from an array
Use {} to inject javascript
Use ? :

var can be updated and re-declared.
let can be updated but not re-declared.
